Intellij IDEA plugin for static code analysis

1. 
The user wants to keep track of the good quality of code written in Kotlin, without using any 3pp paid tools, like Sonar.
The user wants to find the most unmaintanable parts of the code for future analysis and refactoring.

2. 
1) Static code analysis inside IntelliJ Idea for the code written in Kotlin.
2) Calculate metrics for single methods and classes, like: Cyclomatic Complexity, Maintainability index, Comments rate.
3) Possibility to find "the worst" methods and classes by specific metric or set of metrics in the whole project.
4) Generate and read reports inside IntelliJ.
